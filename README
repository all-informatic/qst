QST - QT Serial Terminal

Implements a terminal program using Qt5.

This terminal program mixes the input and output into one terminal
window, unlike other terminal programs which have separate input and
output windows.  The intended use of the program is to communicate with
embedded systems over a serial port.

The program builds for both Windows XP and Linux platforms.  See other
README files for details.  There is no Mac port yet, because I don't
have access to a Mac.  Feel free to port to the Mac and send me back
the patches.

Currently the program only supports N-8-1 serial format.  It should be
simple to support E-7-1, but I don't have any embedded devices that use
that format, so it isn't implemented.

Building:

Qt5 is required, and the Qt serial ports package is required.

Untar the files somewhere, which will create the qst/ directory.

Qt Creator: Open the file qst/qst.pro.  This should open the project.
Be sure you are using a Qt5 build kit. Now compile by pressing the
compile button or from the Build menu on the main menu.

Command line:  Go to the qst directory.  Type this:

qmake  (be sure it's Qt5 version of qmake)
make

The project should build.

Notes on Building QST on Windows XP

To run the program outside of QTCreator, you will have to copy a bunch
of DLL files to the same directory where the qst.exe file is located.
To find out what these dll files are, you can simply try to execute
the qst.exe file, and fix each "missing dll" error by copying the
correct dll file into the same directory as the qst.exe file, or to
wherever system DLL's are expected to live in windows.
