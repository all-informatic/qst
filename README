QST - QT Serial Terminal

Implements a terminal program using QT and the QExtSerialPort library.

This terminal program mixes the input and output into one terminal
window, unlike other terminal programs which have separate input and
output windows.  The intended use of the program is to communicate with
embedded systems over a serial port.

The program builds for both Windows XP and Linux platforms.  See other
README files for details.  There is no MAC port yet, because I don't
have access to a MAC.  Feel free to port to the MAC and send me back
the patches.

Currently the program only supports N-8-1 serial format.  It should be
simple to support E-7-1, but I don't have any embedded devices that use
that format, so it isn't implemented.

Arranging the sources:

QST depends on the QExtSerialPort library.  You must obtain the source
for QExtSerialPort from http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/.  Do
not use the older version from SourceForge.

Place the QExtSerialPort source directory alongside the QST directory,
like this:

somedir
   qextserialport/
   qst/

Building:

Build the qextserialport project first. Using QTCreator, open the
project in qextserialport/src, not the project in qextserialport/.
That project builds some example programs that we don't need.  You
should end up with a library file (libqextserialportd.a) or DLL
(libqextserialportd.dll) on Win32.

Now build the QST project.  You may need to adjust the paths in the
qst.pro file if the compilation fails.  Especially on windows, where
the qextserialport library filenames and paths seem to change of their
own accord.
